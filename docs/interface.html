<title>Using WingEd</title>
<h1>Using WingEd</h1>

<p>Selecting any tool or hovering over any menu item will show help text in the status bar. All keyboard shortcuts can be found in the menus.</p>

<h2 id="view">View</h2>

<p>Drag with the right mouse button to orbit the camera. Drag with the middle button to pan. Scroll to zoom in/out, or hold Shift and middle-drag to move the camera forward/back.</p>

<p>The View menu includes toggles for Wireframe mode, orthographic views, and first-person perspective.</p>

<p>You can also create multiple viewports, allowing you to view the model from multiple angles simultaneously.</p>

<h2 id="selection">Selection</h2>

<p>There are two selection modes: <strong>Elements</strong>, for selecting vertices, edges, and faces, and <strong>Solids</strong> for selecting closed solid surfaces.</p>

<h2 id="tools">Tools</h2>

<p>These can be selected in the toolbar or the Tool menu.</p>

<h3 id="select">Select</h3>

<p>Left-click an object to select. Hold <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Shift</code> to select multiple.</p>

<p>The Select tool is also used to move objects. Click and drag anywhere to move objects along an axis-aligned plane. Holding <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Shift</code> will constrain movement to a single axis, and holding <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Ctrl</code> will move forward/backward (perpendicular to the plane).</p>

<p>Hold <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Alt</code> and drag to move objects along the selected face plane.</p>

<p>By default movement is snapped to a grid. You can use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">]</code> shortcuts to quickly adjust the grid size, or press <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">G</code> to toggle the grid on/off.</p>

<h3 id="polygon">Polygon</h3>

<p>The Polygon tool is used to create new double-sided planes by drawing the points of a polygon. Points are drawn on the plane of the last face that you selected.</p>

<p>Click to place a new point, press Backspace to delete the last point. After drawing a shape, click the first point again to complete the polygon.</p>

<p>Once your polygon is created, you will likely want to <a href="#extrude-face">extrude</a> it.</p>

<h3 id="knife">Knife</h3>

<p>The Knife tool is used to create vertices and edges. You can split an edge with a vertex by clicking it, or carve edges into a face by clicking vertices in sequence.</p>

<p>Once you click a vertex, the knife stays attached to that vertex so you can draw edges connected to it. Press Escape to complete the drawing.</p>

<p>There are a couple rules to keep in mind:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Faces cannot contain holes, therefore if you want to carve a hole into a face, it must have a “bridge” edge connecting it to the outer loop.</li>
  <li>Similarly, you cannot start drawing in the middle of a face, you have to begin with a vertex or edge.</li>
  <li>The Knife uses the most recent face you hovered over to determine where to carve edges. This is highlighted in the editor.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="join">Join</h3>

<p>The Join tool is used to remove vertices, edges, or faces, by gluing them together.</p>

<p>With a single vertex/edge/face selected, switch to the Join tool and click another one to join them. Or, click them both in sequence while in the Join tool.</p>

<p>Edges and vertices must share a face to be joined. Like the Knife tool, the last hovered face is used.</p>

<p>Joining faces is the reverse of the <a href="#split-edge-loop">Split Edge Loop</a> operation – it will connect two edge loops together and remove the opposing faces.</p>

<h2 id="operations">Operations</h2>

<p>These are all available in the Edit menu.</p>

<h3 id="erase">Erase</h3>
<p>In Elements mode, erase selected vertices/edges and join neighboring edges/faces. In Solids mode, delete any selected solids.</p>

<h3 id="extrude-face">Extrude Face</h3>

<p>Extrude the selected face by creating faces surrounding its edges. The face will flash to show something happened, but you won’t see the results until you <a href="#select">move</a> it. (Hold <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Ctrl</code>+<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Alt</code> to move perpendicular to the face.)</p>

<p>If you also select some subset of the edges surrounding the face, only those edges will be extruded.</p>

<h3 id="split-edge-loop">Split Edge Loop</h3>

<p>You must select a continuous loop of coplanar edges. This operation will create opposing faces from the edges, and can be used to split a solid surface in two.</p>

<h3 id="duplicate">Duplicate</h3>

<p>Duplicate selected solids (requires <a href="#selection">Solid</a> mode). The copies will be created at the same position, so they won’t be visible until you move them.</p>

<h3 id="flip-normals">Flip Normals</h3>

<p>Reverse the direction of faces, either for selected solids or the entire model. This can be used to build interior spaces (flipping the normals of a box will create a room).</p>

<h3 id="snap-vertices">Snap Vertices</h3>

<p>Align all vertices to the grid.</p>

<h3 id="transform-matrix">Transform Matrix</h3>

<p>This opens a dialog for you to enter a 3x3 affine matrix for more complex transformations. Objects are transformed around the median point.</p>
